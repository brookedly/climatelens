Course Project INF 134 Project in User Interaction Software


Climate Lens:

  Initially, we came into the project with our focus revolving around raising awareness about climate change and 
  motivating users to fight against it through AR. Currently our project has evolved to focusing instead about 
  raising awareness about the urgency and giving users a communal platform to create solutions. The change of 
  focus arrived from early user research and testing where we discovered that most users knew about climate change, 
  but were not terribly concerned or felt disconnected. The change in focus towards a communal platform came 
  later after we realized the futility of developing the augment reality hotspots on time for our MVP deadline 
  and understanding the power that communities play in creating change. The validation testing was crucial in 
  switching our focus to a community focus and highlighted the needs to solidify an identity for our project. 
  Furthermore positive feedback from users about our local orgs screen provided additional about the potential 
  success of focusing on the local community aspect. In the future we hope to build on this by adding more social 
  media and community functionality such as sharing, chat rooms, or news feeds. In conclusion, ClimateLens has 
  evolved from a gimmicky visual stimulate to a fleshed out central hub for users to start working towards a 
  larger communal solution to climate change.
